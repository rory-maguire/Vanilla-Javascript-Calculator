# Vanilla-Javascript-Calculator

A vanilla javascript calculator.

I like this clean solution to building a calculator by 

- making the buttons iterable using Array.from()
- mapping through the buttons
- adding an event listener to each of them
- using switch statement depending on what display reads
- using eval() to read the innertext value of this display for calculations
